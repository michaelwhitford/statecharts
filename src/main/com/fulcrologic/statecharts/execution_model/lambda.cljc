  "Create a new execution model that expects state machine expressions to be `(fn [env data])`. Such expressions
   can return arbitrary values, can use the data model from the `env` to side-effect into the data model. If
   an expression (NOT as a condition) returns a vector, then an attempt will be made to run it as a data model
   update.

   The options map can contain:

   * :explode-event? - Boolean (default false). If true the execution model will pre-extract the event name
     and event data from the data model (:_event). In this case your statechart must use arity-4 functions
     (at least in CLJ) for `(fn [env data event-name event-data] ...)`."
