(ns com.fulcrologic.statecharts.data-model.working-memory-data-model
  "An implementation of DataModel that stores the data in working memory itself.

   Supports using `src` in data model for CLJ ONLY, which must be a URI that clojure.java.io/reader
   would accept.

   There are two implementations: One where data is scoped to the state, and another where it is global.

(defn new-model
  "Creates a data model where data is stored in the working memory of the state machine.
   The data is scoped to the state it is declared or set in (visible to states
   below it). Locations in this data model are [state-id key], where the special state-id :ROOT stands
   for the top-level machine scope.  Using a keyword as a location is resolved relative to the current
   state, then parent, parent parent, etc.

   `current-data` is a merge of all data for the contextual state from root, with each nested state overriding anything
   that appeared in a parent state.

   `get-at` will NOT walk scopes, but supports simple keywords for the current context,
   and paths of the form `[state-id data-key]`. The special state-id `:ROOT` is reserved for those at the top-most level.

   The operations implemented for this model can be extended by adding to the multimethod `run-op`.

   WARNING: This model is not recommended for many use-cases. The contextual paths turn out to be
   rather difficult to reason about. The flat data model is recommended."
