  "Behavioral tests for the promise adapter.

   ## Modes

   The adapter chooses between two implementations at load time:

   * **`:promesa`** — promesa is on the classpath. Every primitive is a
     direct alias for `promesa.core`. Our `p/X` and the consumer's
     `promesa.core/X` are literally the same fn/macro and produce the
     same promise type, so 'interop' tests become tautological at runtime
     — but they still verify call sites compose without error.

   * **`:native`** — promesa not loadable (notably babashka). Our
     IPending-backed impl is used standalone. Native-mode coverage lives
     in the bb smoke test at `test-bb/smoke.clj`.

   These CLJ specs run under `:dev`, so they execute in `:promesa` mode.
   The first spec asserts that fact explicitly.

   ## Platform split

   * **CLJ** — Has `p/await!`, so specs read straight-line: build a
     chain, await the result, assert.
   * **CLJS** — `js/Promise` cannot be blocked on, so specs use
     `cljs.test/async` and chain assertions inside `.then`. Our CLJS impl
     uses js/Promise natively; promesa-cljs's `PromiseImpl` interops
     through the standard JS Thenable contract."
