;; Run the project's test suite under babashka.
;;
;; Usage (from this directory):
;;
;;   bb --config bb-tests.edn -f run-tests.clj
;;
;; Or from the project root:
;;
;;   make bb-tests
;;
;; ## What this proves
;;
;; That every test namespace that can be loaded under SCI (i.e. doesn't
;; pull in fulcro/promesa directly) passes against the bb-native build of
;; statecharts. Combined with `smoke.clj`, this gives end-to-end evidence
;; that the library's algorithm + async surface works in babashka.
;;
;; ## Known skips
;;
;; - integration/fulcro*       — require fulcro, which is not bb-loadable.
;; - routing_demo2/*           — require fulcro.
;; - data_model/integration/*  — require fulcro.
;; - promise_spec              — its CLJ interop tests load promesa.core.
;; - algorithms/.../async_spec — same: loads promesa.core directly.
;; - chart_validation_spec /
;;   convenience_spec          — use fulcro-spec's `=throws=>`, whose
;;                               macro expansion embeds a literal
;;                               java.lang.Throwable Class that SCI
;;                               cannot resolve at runtime.
;;
;; The full CLJ kaocha suite covers all of these on the JVM. Here we just
;; need to prove every other test still passes when the runtime is SCI.
